### -Cycle a submersible pump on command
#### -Will cycle pump on command if level in supply tank is high enough
### -Is controlled by an IR Remote
### -Has a timer to cycle the pump periodically
### -Has an ultrasonic sensor to check supply tank level
#### -Cycles a buzzer if level is not above 6 inches
#### -Will cycle pump on command if level in supply tank is high enough
## NOTE: IN THE CURRENT VERSION, COPY AND PASTE TO THE ARDUINO IDE, GITHUB HAS THIS AS A C++ FILE

To Do:

[ ] -Add buzzer functionality
[ ] -Add time functionality
[ ] -Add aditional run time options

Future Plans:

[ ] -Add Countdown Display for timer and run time

# Infrared Remote Controlled Submersible Pump
## Code that runs on an Arduino Mega that will:
### Provides remote control for a submersible pump that does the following:  
   -Runs the pump when commanded for a specified amount of time  
   -Is controlled by an IR Remote  
   -Has an ultrasonic sensor to check supply tank level  
   -Cycles a buzzer if level is not above 6 inches
   -Will not start the pump if level is to low  
   -Has a timer to cycle the pump periodically  

The physical system this is meant to operate is a small submersible pump, supplied by some sort of sump, that discharges to a water load, such as a set of houseplants.  
## NOTE: IN THE CURRENT VERSION, COPY AND PASTE TO THE ARDUINO IDE, UPLOADED TO GITHUB AS AN C++ FILE, WRITTEN IN VISUAL STUDIO

To Do:  
[ ] -Add buzzer functionality  
[ ] -Add timer functionality  
[ ] -Add aditional run time options beyond 5 seconds and 1 minute  

Future Plans:  
[ ] -Add countdown display for timer and run time

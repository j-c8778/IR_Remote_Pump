# IR_Remote_Pump
## Code that runs on an Arduino Mega that will:
### -Remotely control a submersible pump that does the following:  
   -Runs the pump when commanded for a specified amount of time  
   -Is controlled by an IR Remote  
   -Has a timer to cycle the pump periodically  
   -Has an ultrasonic sensor to check supply tank level  
   -Cycles a buzzer if level is not above 6 inches
   -Will not start the pump if level is to low

## NOTE: IN THE CURRENT VERSION, COPY AND PASTE TO THE ARDUINO IDE, GITHUB HAS THIS AS A C++ FILE

To Do:  
[ ] -Add buzzer functionality  
[ ] -Add timer functionality  
[ ] -Add aditional run time options beyond 5 seconds and 1 minute  

Future Plans:  
[ ] -Add countdown display for timer and run time
